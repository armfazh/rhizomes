abstract: >
   Prio, tailored under privacy-by-design principles, is a protocol 
   for aggregating client-provided measurements between non-colluding
   entities. The validity of measurements is determined by using a 
   fully linear probabilistically-checkable proof (FLPCP). The Prover
   distributes secret shares of the measurement and the proof to multiple
   Verifiers. These Verifiers can only use linear queries on the input
   statement for validation without accessing the actual measurement.
   Efficiency is key for the practical application of Prio. The FLPCP
   operates with polynomials represented in the Lagrange basis using
   roots of unity as the nodes. However, we observe opportunities to
   improve its performance by embracing the Lagrange basis more 
   extensively. For instance, we show an inversion-free O(n) 
   time-complexity algorithm for polynomial evaluation in the Lagrange
   basis (an alternative to the classic rational barycentric formula).
   By applying our methods to libprio-rs, a cutting-edge Rust 
   implementation, the Sharding phase (proof generation) runs a 36% 
   faster and the Prep-Init phase (proof verification) is twice as 
   fast, showing a substantial acceleration of the most time-consuming
   phases of Prio.
